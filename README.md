# LaTeX template for WG21 papers

This is a LaTeX template for ISO C++ committee (aka WG21) papers. You can use this as a starting point if you are authoring such a paper and prefer to use LaTeX.

The template defines some useful macros in "common.tex". They are adapted from the C++ Standard Draft Sources (https://github.com/cplusplus/draft.git) with some modifications (removed functionality appropriate for the standard but unnecessary for papers, such as grammar term backreferences and table captions). You can find examples for using the most common macros in the main document named "dXXXrX.text" (which you should replace with your actual paper number).
